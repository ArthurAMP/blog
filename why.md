title: why blogging?
--- 

I'm not a great communicator, nor a great writer. (Especially not in English.) However, I deeply value those two skills, and this blog might be a way to practice them. 

I'm passionate about education, and the thing that all the mentors that marked me the most have in common is that they are great storytellers. Thus, if I wish to become a great educator, I need to start telling stories. Let it be about my improvements as a developer, or about whatever is on my mind at the moment.
