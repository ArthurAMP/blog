Hey, I'm Arthur! I'm a 19 yo Brazilian aspiring... developer? Researcher? Professor?

I'm currently in a gap year, planning on applying to U.S. universities next cycle. My areas of interest in CS are machine learning, software development, and cybersecurity.

If you wish to talk or collaborate, just send me an email! I'm always open to chat, as long as I have the time.
