It has been a while since I last coded in C. No project I'm involved in uses C at all. So, to start the 100 days challenge, I'll make a simple 1-2 day project to recap some important concepts, like file management, header files and other important concepts that I feel I might be a little rusty.

I'll be using neovim throughout the challenge, and as I'm almost a brand-new beginner on vim, I'll probably take twice as much time to code the first few projects than I normally would. Also, if I decide to do some vim practice, I will be counting towards the 100 days of code challenge and no one can stop me. (Cue evil laughter.)

After this starting project, I'll most likely read [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/) and move on to the first "real" project of developing a reverse shell.

Aside from that, I don't have much of a direction. 

I kinda want to learn WebAssembly so I can maybe put some GUI C projects in a future portfolio website and finally get a job or something. Most of the things I coded aren't very visual and I didn't even publish them on the internet It's almost like I hate money. So maybe having a chip8 emulator on my personal website might help me show my skills on my job applications.

At this point I believe the best approach is to play it by ear. If a project catches my attention during the 100 days I'm willing to change plans. There is a non-zero chance that I become a rustling before the challenge is over and it becomes a 100 days of Rust challenge, and I'm willing to embrace this change if it ever comes to that.
