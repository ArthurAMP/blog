This series of post start on [this post](/blog/100-days-day-19).

Let's not waste much time and go straight to the opcodes, shall we? 

Thankfully, they start pretty easy. They do have some spiceness associated with them later though. 

By the way, there are many starting with 8, so we have to nest switch statements. We differentiate them by the last position. 

```
case 0x8000:
    switch(opcode&0x000F){
            
    case 0x0000:
    ...
    }
```

- LD, OR, AND, and XOR Vx, Vy

Nothing interesting about these opcodes, it is just like the LD Vx, byte one, substituing the byte for a register and using different bitwise operations.

```
case 0x0000:
    c8->V[opcode&0x0F00>>8] = c8->V[opcode&0x00F0>>4];
    c8->pc += 2;
    break;
case 0x0001:
    c8->V[opcode&0x0F00>>8] |= c8->V[opcode&0x00F0>>4];
    c8->pc += 2;
    break;
case 0x0002:
    c8->V[opcode&0x0F00>>8] &= c8->V[opcode&0x00F0>>4];
    c8->pc += 2;
    break;
case 0x0003:
    c8->V[opcode&0x0F00>>8] ^= c8->V[opcode&0x00F0>>4];
    c8->pc += 2;
    break;
```

8xy4 starts getting a little spicy though.

- ADD Vx, Vy

Summing two registers comes with a problem, we have to deal with integer overflow. The simpler way to deal with that which I came up with is to create an 16-bit integer to recieve the sum of Vx and Vy, which are two 8-bit integers. After that, we check if that temporary integer is over 255, if so, it means that Vx+Vy cannot be stored in a single 8-bit integer so we should set the carry flag to 1. 

```
case 0x0004:
    uint16_t a = c8->V[opcode&0x0F00>>8] + 
    c8->V[opcode&0x00F0>>4];
    c8->V[15] = a>255;
    c8->V[opcode&0x0F00>>8] += c8->V[opcode&0x00F0>>4];
    c8->pc += 2;
    break;
```

The coolest tech on this implementation is the a>255 statement. Remember those types of comparings always return 1 if true and 0 if false. So instead of making an if statement to set V\[15\], I just used the > operator. I use this again on SUBN and SUB. 

- SUB Vx, Vy

But checking for integer underflow is very easy. We just have to check if Vy is bigger than Vx. If so, Vx-Vy would be smaller than 0 and underflow an unsigned integer. 

```
case 0x0005:
    c8->V[15] = c8->V[opcode&0x0F00>>8] > 
        c8->V[opcode&0x00F0>>4];
    c8->V[opcode&0x0F00>>8] -= c8->V[opcode&0x00F0>>4];
    c8->pc += 2;
    break;
```

- SHR Vx

Pretty straightforward implementation. I did create a temporary variable to store opcode&0x0F00>>8 so I wouldn't have to type that two times. This made me wonder if it would be better if I made that a macro on the code, but I was too lazy to do so.

```
case 0x0006:
    uint16_t x = opcode&0x0F00>>8;
    c8->V[15] = c8->V[x]>>7;
    c8->V[x] /= 2;
    c8->pc += 2;
    break;
```

- SUBN Vx, Vy

Opposite SUB. Not sure if I have much to add besides this.

```
case 0x0007:
    c8->V[15] = c8->V[opcode&0x00F0>>4] > 
        c8->V[opcode&0x0F00>>8];
    c8->V[opcode&0x0F00>>8] = c8->V[opcode&0x00F0>>4] -
        c8->V[opcode&0x0F00>>8];
    c8->pc += 2;
    break;
```

- SHL Vx

(Almost) opposite SHR. 

```
case 0x000E:
    uint16_t x = opcode&0x0F00>>8;
    c8->V[15] = c8->V[x]>>7; 
    c8->V[x] *= 2;
    c8->pc += 2;
    break;
```

And that's it for the opcodes starting with 8. But now I gotta run. If you have any questions, hit me up at arthurmpapp@gmail.com.
