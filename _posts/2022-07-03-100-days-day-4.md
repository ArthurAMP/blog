title: day 4 - network pt2 - getting ip addresses!

Yesterday I spent my morning and afternoon preparing for an interview, then after the interview I had more stuff to do, so no code yesterday :(

Today I went back to struggling with Network Programming. I saw on [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/) an example of a code to show the ip address of a specified hostname, so I decided to rewrite it to learn by myself. I tried looking at his code the least I could, but it was too hard for me, so my code ended up being almost a carbon copy. Oops. At least I got to understand what was happening, so I can explain to you people. 

The program recieves one argument, which is the hostname, and prints the hosts' IP address. The code ended up looking like this.

```
/*
    This code was rewritten from the showip.c example on Beej's Guide to Network Programming
    https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/examples/showip.c
*/

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netdb.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void a_gai(struct addrinfo *x, struct addrinfo **list, char *ip){
    
    int status;
    
    if((status=getaddrinfo(ip, NULL, x, list))!=0){
        
        fprintf(stderr, "getaddrinfo error: %s\n", gai_strerror(status));
        exit(1);
    }
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    
    struct addrinfo hints, *res, *p;
    char ipstr[INET6_ADDRSTRLEN];
    char *hostname = argv[1];
        
    if(argc!=2){

        fprintf(stderr, "usage: showip hostname");
        return 1;
    }

    memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(hints));
    hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;
    hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
    
    a_gai(&hints, &res, hostname);

    printf("IP address for %s\n\n", argv[1]);

    for(p = res; p != NULL; p = p->ai_next){
        
        void *addr; 
        char *ipver;

        if(p->ai_family == AF_INET) {
            
            struct sockaddr_in *ipv4 = (struct sockaddr_in *)p->ai_addr;
            addr = &(ipv4->sin_addr);
            ipver = "IPv4";
        }else{
        
            struct sockaddr_in6 *ipv6 = (struct sockaddr_in6 *)p->ai_addr;
            addr = &(ipv6->sin6_addr);
            ipver = "IPv6";
        }

        inet_ntop(p->ai_family, addr, ipstr, sizeof(ipstr));
        printf("%s: %s\n", ipver, ipstr);
    }
    
    a

    return 0;
}
```

This might look complex but it really isn't. Let's tackle it step by step, starting from main. 

```
struct addrinfo hints, *res, *p;
```

The first new thing is already on the first line: the struct addrinfo. It is composed by several data about an specific address. Let's take a look at it.

```
struct addrinfo {
    int     ai_flags;
    int     ai_family;
    int     ai_socktype;
    int     ai_protocol;
    size_t  ai_addrlen;
    struct  sockaddr *ai_addr;
    char    *ai_canonname;     
    struct  addrinfo *ai_next; 
};
```

**ai_flags:** options we can specify about the request we are making. For example, specifying ai_flags as AI_PASSIVE will fill in your IP as the hostname. For more information on the flags, please refer to the man page of getaddrinfo().

**ai_family:** this flag will be AF_INET when it is an IPv4, and AF_INET6 if it is an IPv6. When passing the configurations to the getaddrinfo() function, you can specify this flag as AF_UNSPEC if you want your code to work for both IPv4 and IPv6.

**ai_socktype:** refers to the type of socket you want to use, stream or datagram (SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM). Stream is usually TCP and Dgram is usually UDP. If you don't know the difference, Beej's Guide to Network Programming explains it well and I might do a blog post on it later. 

**ai_protocol:** set this flag to specify the protocol, or set it to 0 to use any protocol, which is what I usually do.

These are all that you might have to specify. Let's talk about the ones that will be filled by themselves when you call getaddrinfo();

**ai_addrlen:** the length of the address. Very creative. 

**ai_addr:** a struct inside a struct :(. But worry not, this one is really small and self-explanatory, I'll just comment the lines of the struct. 

```
struct sockaddr {
    unsigned short    sa_family;    // Type of address. AF_INET if IPv4, AF_INET6 if 
    // IPv6, and AF_XXX if it's some weird thing
    char              sa_data[14];  // Protocol address with port number. 
}; 
```

People don't really like sockaddr because it is the worst. It is hard to refer to the port number and the address separately and it might lead to you having to parse the IP address by hand into sockaddr. Thankfully, there are these two alternatives, one for IPv4 and one for IPv6:

IPv4:
```
struct sockaddr_in {
    short int          sin_family;  
    unsigned short int sin_port;    
    struct in_addr     sin_addr; // Literally just an address 32-bit int, I don't 
    // know why it is a struct.
    unsigned char      sin_zero[8]; 
};
```
IPv6:
```
struct sockaddr_in6 {
    u_int16_t       sin6_family;   
    u_int16_t       sin6_port;     
    u_int32_t       sin6_flowinfo; 
    struct in6_addr sin6_addr;     // Literally just an address string, I don't know 
    // why it is a struct.
    u_int32_t       sin6_scope_id; 
};
```

We can cast sockaddr_in or sockaddr_in6 into a sockaddr pointer, so we can use sockaddr_in(6) together with the addrinfo struct.

To finish off addrinfo:

**\*ai_canonname:** the canonical hostname of the host.

**\*ainext:** this lets us use addrinfo as an linked list. Yay! If you don't know what a linked list is, [wikipedia has you covered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list)

Whew. We spent quite some time talking about a single struct. But the fact that we spent so much time on this will make the rest a breeze. Just so you know, I'll be skipping the non-network parts so if you have any problems with the C basics, just send me an email and I'll be glad to help.

```
memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(hints));
hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
```

Hints will be the configs for when we call getaddrinfo, so we use memset to guarantee it is all zeroes, then we specify ai_family and ai_socktype as we talked about beforehand. 

```
a_gai(&hints, &res, hostname);
```

This is a function I coded to make the code a little cleaner. Let's check it out.

```
void a_gai(struct addrinfo *x, struct addrinfo **list, char *ip){
    
    int status;
    
    if((status=getaddrinfo(ip, NULL, x, list))!=0){
        
        fprintf(stderr, "getaddrinfo error: %s\n", gai_strerror(status));
        exit(1);
    }
}
```

Finally, getaddrinfo! Let's check it out. 

```
int getaddrinfo(const char *node, // Hostname  
                const char *service, // Port
                const struct addrinfo *hints, // Configs/flags 
                struct addrinfo **res); // Linked list that recieves the results.
```

The function will fill the variables we mentioned beforehand, like ai_addr and ai_next, intializing the linked list.

Great! Now that we know both the parameters and what it does, we know that after calling a_gai, res will be a linked list with the request data.

```
for(p = res; p != NULL; p = p->ai_next){
        
    void *addr; 
    char *ipver;

    if(p->ai_family == AF_INET) {
            
        struct sockaddr_in *ipv4 = (struct sockaddr_in *)p->ai_addr;
        addr = &(ipv4->sin_addr);
        ipver = "IPv4";
    }else{
        
        struct sockaddr_in6 *ipv6 = (struct sockaddr_in6 *)p->ai_addr;
        addr = &(ipv6->sin6_addr);
        ipver = "IPv6";
    }

    inet_ntop(p->ai_family, addr, ipstr, sizeof(ipstr));
    printf("%s: %s\n", ipver, ipstr);
}
```

I don't have much to explain in this excerpt that I didn't talk beforehand. Try to make sense of it on your own, refering back to what I've said beforehand when needed. The only new thing is inet_ntop(), which is a function that converts the IP addresses from binary to readable text. It is the opposite of inet_pton().

To finish it off, we use ```freeaddrinfo(res);``` to free the list's memory and we are done! You just learned how to write your first code using sockets in C! I hope you had fun learning this and if you have any questions, hit me up at arthurmpapp@gmail.com!

See ya!
