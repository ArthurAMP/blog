This post assumes you read the [post on Segment Trees](/blog/100-days-day-17).

Procrastinating is sometimes optimal. Let's say you really want to have some ice cream, which is sold at the nearest supermarket. 

Going to the supermarket just to have some ice cream is not very time-efficient. So most people would instead opt to wait until they need to shop for groceries to buy the ice cream.

Lazy Propagation is exactly that. If instead of the updating only one number at the time on the array, you need to update a range of numbers, postpone updating a node until you absolutely need to update it.

Ok, this metaphor is not great. But it kinda works... right? 

Let's go back to our ol' segtree:

![](/blog/imgs/7th-step.svg)

Let's say you want to update the first four numbers of the array, by, I dunno, summing three to each number. Making four separated updates to do so would be catastrophically slow, O(n\*log(n)) slow.

So instead of doing so, why don't we just make some kind of ledger? 

Like, every node I mentioned is contained by the node 2. So we might as well only update 2 and say to their children: "hey, remember you need to update yourself and your children. But to be efficient, only do it when a query or a update function reaches you." 

By doing so, we escape from any unneeded computations because we only update a node when we need its value, and we only do so when taking advantage of the fact we are already in the node.

To do so, we would create an array called "lazy", where we would store the updates we still didn't deal with, like this:

![](/blog/imgs/lazy.svg)

The red +3 would be the value of the lazy vector for the node. 

Remember we have to update with a +3 every member of the subset, so if we were to update node 4 and 5, we would not just sum 3 in the node. We would sum 3\*2 = 6.

And that's about it for Lazy Propagation. Kind of annoying to understand, but very simple at its core. Let's jump to the code.

```
void unlazy(int node, int l, int r){
    
    if(lazy[node] == 0){
        // if lazy[node] is 0, we kind of don't have anything to do
        return;
    }

    // if it isn't 0, we have to update seg[node]
    // the update is lazy multiplied by r-l
    // because a given node would increase in value
    // lazy * the number of elements in the subset
    // because we will eventually sum lazy
    // in each of the elements.
    seg[node] += (r-l)*lazy[node];

    if(l != r) {
        // if it isn't a leaf
        lazy[2*node] = lazy[node];
        lazy[2*node+1] = lazy[node];
        // lazy propagate!
    }

    lazy[node] = 0;
    // lazy is no more
}
```
This is the unlazy function. It updates the current node based on the lazy array. Very cool. Again, this time I prefered explaining inside the code with comments.

```
#define M (l+r)/2
void build(int node, int l, int r){

    if(l==r){
        seg[node] = V[l];
        return;
    }
    
    build(2*node, l, M);
    build(2*node + 1, M+1, r);

    seg[node] = seg[2*node] + seg[2*node+1];
}
```

The build function is the same. Hurray!

```
#define M (l+r)/2
#define lnode 2*node
#define rnode 2*node+1
void update(int node, int l, int r, int rl, int rr, int pos, int v){
    // remember now update recieves a range 
    // instead of pos, because things are different
    // nowadays

    unlazy(node, l, r); // if we are already here,
    // why not buy some ice cream?
    // note: this is kinda required
    // we don't want to go any deeper without unlazying

    if(l>rr || r<ll){
        // out of bounds, abort!
        return;
    }

    if(l==r){

        seg[node] += v;
        return;
    } // this line of code is kinda redundant now,
    // but I like it. It is very visual. 

    if(rl <= l && r <= rr){ 
        // perfectly included, so we can
        // update it and lazy propagate
        lazy[node] += v;
        unlazy[node, l, r];
        return;
    }

    // notice now the update is very similar 
    // to the query because most of the 
    // differences came from update dealing
    // with a single position and query dealing
    // with a range
    update(lnode, l, M, rl, rr, v);
    update(rnode, M+1, r, rl, rr, v);
    // now that it is a range, we might 
    // need to check both directions
    // as the range might not be perfectly
    // inside one half
    seg[node] = seg[lnode] + seg[rnode];
}
```

That's about it for the new update. Now I used a define for lnode and rnode because I was too lazy to keep writing 2\*node and 2\*node+1, and being lazy is kind of thematic for this post.

Now, for the great finale, the query:

```
#define M = (l+r)/2
int query(int node, int l, int r, int rl, int rr){
     
    unlazy(node, l, r); // add this

    if(rr < l || rl>r){
 
        return 0;
    }
    
    if(rl <= l && r <= rr){
        
        return seg[node];
    }
    
    return query(lnode, l, M, rl, rr) + 
    query(rnode, M+1, r, rl, rr);
}
```

The query is literally the same thing besides the fact we need to unlazy in the beginning. 

Very anticlimatic. 

Thats about it on lazy propagation. If you have any questions, reach me at arthurmpapp@gmail.com
