Let's say you have the following array:

```
V = [2, 4, 1, 3, 9, 7, 2]
```

Changing a number on this array is very time-efficient. It is as easy as writing ```V[2] = 4;``` This is only one operation regardless of the position, and the value we want to put in the position. Therefore, updating the array has a time complexity of O(1).

But what if your problem involved updating the array and making querys to the array? For example, getting the sum of a subset in the array? If you only want to make this query once, this would be alright. But making a query of that nature on that array would have a time complexity of O(n) with n being the size of the array. If you were required to make several queries to the array, the slowness of the query would overshadow the quick updating fuction.

Segment Trees (aka segtrees) helps us solve that problem. Using that data structure makes both operations O(log n), which is much faster than O(n). Let's see how it's done, in the lenses of the aforementioned getting the sum of a subset problem. 

First things first, we have to create the segtree. Don't worry if you don't understand why we're creating this tree yet, it will all make sense by the end of this post.

This is the beginning state, with the tree still not built. What we'll want to do is to make every node equal to the sum of their child nodes, starting from the first node.

For that, we'll use a function called build. We'll implement it after I explain what it does. 

We first call that build function on the first node. It will first check if it is a leaf node (a node without children). As it isn't it will call the build function on each of its children. But we'll start with the left child, 2.

As the 2nd node isn't a leaf, it will also call the build function on its children, starting by the left node, 4. 

This will be a recursive function that only will stop when they reach the leaf nodes all the way on the bottom. This will first happen on the 8th and 9th node, as they are the leaves that come from going all the way to the left, and we will implement the recursion by going first on the left and then on the right. 

When the build function reaches a leaf, it makes the leaf node equal to a corresponding member of the array:

![](/blog/imgs/2nd-step.svg)

And the build function is over for the 8th and 9th node.

But remember, the node that called both those nodes was the 4th node. As the execution is over for its children, it can finally go to the final step to a node which isn't a leaf. We'll make the 4th node equal to the sum of 8 and 9. 

![](/blog/imgs/3rd-step.svg)

Now the execution is over for the 4th. So it comes back to the 2nd node, which will call the 5th, which will call the leaf 10 then the leaf 11:

![](/blog/imgs/4th-step.svg)

After that it will come back to the 5th node and make it equal to the sum of node 10 and 11.

As 5th was called by the 2nd node, the execution will come back to two, and now we have all we need to calculate it.

This goes on and on until the tree is completely filled. 

![](/blog/imgs/7th-step.svg)

This takes a time complexity of O(n). Thankfully, we just have to compute this build function once, so it is computationally alright.

Let's see how I implemented this. Keep in mind that although I'm implementing in C++, the intuition is language-agnostic so it isn't that big of a deal. 

```
#define M (l+r)/2
void build(int node, int l, int r){

    // l refers to the first member of the subset
    // represented by the node

    // r represents the rightmost member

    if(l==r) // checking if it is a leaf
    {
        seg[node] = V[l];
        return;
    }
    
    build(2*node, l, M);
    build(2*node + 1, M+1, r);

    seg[node] = seg[2*node] + seg[2*node+1];
}
```

It might be good to visualize the l and r stuff on the tree. 

![](/blog/imgs/subsets.svg)

By virtue of the way we are defining the tree, every node is associated with a different subset. The node 4 is the sum of the subset \[1,2], the node 1 is the sub of the subset \[1,7] (which is the entire set), and so on. So we use that definition on the build function to check if it is a leaf, by seeing if the first element of the subset is the same as the last (as a leaf always only represents a single element). 

So whenever we call build, we specify which subset the node represents. As you can see in the image, the set is always broken in two pieces, one from the beginning to the middle, and one from the middle+1 to the end. We use that property to calculate the beginning and the end of each children's subset. 

Also, if you don't understand the 2\*node and 2\*node+1 part, it is just that by virtue of the way we number the nodes, the left child always will have the index equal to two times the parent's index, and the right child will have two times plus one. This is especially important because that way we can store that tree in a one-dimensional array instead of a two-dimensional one.  

I won't draw all the steps of the two next functions, build and update, because it would make this lesson even more of a slog to read, too many images. 

The update's idea is to change every single node in the path to reaching the node that represents the one we want to change. 

This might be confusing to read, but it's not that hard. Think of the scenario we want to change the third element from an one to a two. Which nodes would we have to change to make sure the whole tree continues with the right subset sum values?

![](/blog/imgs/update.svg)

Only the ones that I painted red.

The algorithm to do so is fairly easy. We just have to check if the position we want to change is to the left or to the right. If it's to the left, we call the update function to the left, and if it's to the right, we call the update function to the right.

This goes on until we reach a leaf. Then we just keep going back on the update line and compute that every node we had to go through is equal to the sum of their children.

```
#define M (l+r)/2
void update(int node, int l, int r, int pos, int v){
    
    if(l==r){ // if we are in a leaf
        // we reached our goal!
        seg[node] = v;
        return;
    }
    
    if(l <= pos && pos <= M){ // checking if pos is included in
    // left node interval
        update(2*node, l, M, pos, v); // if yes, let's update it
    }else{

        update(2*node+1, M+1, r, pos, v); // if not, update
        // the right node
    }

    // after updating, the children will have
    // the correct sum, so we can make sure
    // that this computation will update the current node
    seg[node] = seg[2*node+1] + seg[2*node];
}
```

Now only the query is left. For the query, we'll jump straight to the code.

```
#define M = (l+r)/2
int query(int node, int l, int r, int rangeL, int rangeR){
    // This query computes the sum of the array
    // from the element rangeL to
    // the element rangeR 

    if(rangeR < l || rangeL>r){
        
        // if the rightmost element of the range
        // is to the left of the leftmost element
        // which the node represents, the node is not
        // a part of the sum of the subset
        // so we ignore it and return nothing (aka 0)
        
        // we do the same if the leftmot element
        // of the range is to the right of the
        // rightmost element that the node contains   
        return 0;
    }
    
    if(rangeL <= l && r <= rangeR){
        
        // in turn, if the node is perfectly included
        // by the range, we can just return the node's
        // value
        return seg[node];
    }
    
    // if it's not out of bounds and not perfectly included
    // we have to go deeper in the tree to find elements
    // that are entirely included to add them to the
    // sum of the subset.
    return query(2*node, l, M, rangeL, rangeR) + 
    query(2*node + 1, M+1, r, rangeL, rangeR);
}
```

I don't think I can explain the query function much better than the comments that go together with the code.

And this is it! Combining these three functions guarantee that you can build the segtree in O(n) time, make queries in O(log n), and update any value in O(log n) as well. Keep in mind that sum segment trees aren't the only types of segtree that exists. You could code a segtree that computed the biggest value in a subset, for example. You'd just have to make minor adjustments in each of the functions.

In case of a max segtree, you'd just change every line that sums the left node wit the right node to a line which computes the max() of the two nodes.

Phew! This was hard to explain, and I think I should probably get back to this post sometime in the future to explain the query function a little better.
