I'm not brand new to coding, I've started several years ago with competitive programming and since then I've studied quite a bit of algorithms, data structures, and coding concepts. However, by trying to contribute to Open Source Software I've realized that learning how to code and learning how to develop software are two different things. 
 
Through this challenge, I hope to bridge the gap between just programming and actually developing. I will be focusing on project-based learning throughout the challenge and I will be blogging the progress I made each day. If you want to follow along, I believe all you will need to know is the basics of C, like input and output, pointers and structs.

### goals

I've set some goals that I hope to achieve by the end of this challenge, which are:

- Learning how to use CMake
- Learning how to make pretty CLI applications
- Developing a text editor
- Contributing to an open source repository with C or C++ 


### resources

This is a list of all of the tutorials or materials that helped me with the projects. I will be updating this list of resources as I go through the challenge.
