[the problem (1584)](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points/)

When approaching any problems envolving points in a plane and connections, you should immediately think, "can I make a graph out of this?" 

In this problem, the answer is yes. And not only that, if we can manage to make a graph out of the input, the problem becomes just making a Minimum Spanning Tree!

If you don't know about MSTs, don't worry. Word is that there is an [amazing blog post](/blog/100-days-day-6) that teaches everything you have to know about the Kruskal's algorithm.

Ok, now we have a clear goal in mind, making a graph. The thing we have to notice is that, technically, every point is connected. So we can make an edge list and add every possible connection between points on the list.

This approach will create a lot of useless edges, but Kruskal's algorithm will get rid of those for us. 

This is how I implemented the loop to create the graph.

```
int counti = 1, countj = 1, nedges = 0;

for(auto &i:points){

    countj = 1;

    for(auto &j:points){

        if(counti!=countj && counti<countj){
                    
            edges[++nedges].x = counti; 
            edges[nedges].y = countj;
            edges[nedges].dist = abs(i[0]-j[0]) + abs(i[1]-j[1]);
        }

        countj++;
    }
            
    counti++;
}
```

I'll be the first one to admit it, this isn't the cleanest of codes. But it does get the job done. 

Let's talk about this loop.

```
auto &i:points
```

If you never read this type of loop, worry not, it is very simple. This is the way of doing range-based loops in C++. Kinda like python's ```for x in y:``` 

The "auto" type is just to let our smart compiler deduce the type for us instead of typing something like vector<int> &i or something like that. 

If you are familiar with iterators, this is pretty much the same as doing a for loop like this:

```
for(auto *it = points.begin(); it != points.end(); ++it)
```

By making a for loop inside a for loop, i and j will together be at some point every combination of points.

Although I said we don't mind a few useless edges, there are some of those that we can weed out even before Kruskal to save us time and memory!

```
if(counti != countj && counti < countj )
```

The first condition checks if we are trying to put an edge between a point and itself. I can't imagine an connection of that nature being very useful.

The second one is a little trickier. By removing every connection where the second point has a index bigger than the first, we filter out any repeat connections. Without that, we would have both the connection 1--2 and the connection 2--1 in our edge list, for example.

These fixes saves us basically half of the whole code's memory because we can make our edge list have half the size it would normally have, and the list is the biggest structure in the code.

```
edges[++nedges].x = counti; 
edges[nedges].y = countj;
edges[nedges].dist = abs(i[0]-j[0]) + abs(i[1]-j[1]);
```

And now we can finally create the edge, using manhattan's distance to calculate the distance between the two points, as the question commanded. 

Now that we created our graph, the problem becomes just coding the kruskal as we normally would. My Kruskal tutorial is linked [here](/blog/100-days-day-6). If you want to read the full code, here it is:

```
#define maxn 1001

class Solution {
public:
    struct edge{
        int dist;
        int x, y;
    };

    int parent[maxn];
    int weight[maxn];
    edge edges[maxn*maxn/2];
    edge mst[maxn];

    static bool compare(edge a, edge b){ 
        return a.dist < b.dist; 
    }

    int find(int x){
        if (parent[x] == x){
            return x;
        }
        return parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
    }

    void join(int a, int b){
    
        a = find(a);
        b = find(b);
    
        if (weight[a] < weight[b]) parent[a] = b;
        else if (weight[b] < weight[a]) parent[b] = a;
        else{

            parent[a] = b;
            weight[b]++;
        }
    }

    int minCostConnectPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        
        int counti = 1, countj = 1, nedges = 0;
        int w = 0;
        
        for(auto &i:points){
            countj = 1;
            parent[counti] = counti;
            for(auto &j:points){
                if(counti!=countj && counti<countj){
                    
                    edges[++nedges].x = counti; 
                    edges[nedges].y = countj;
                    edges[nedges].dist = abs(i[0]-j[0]) + abs(i[1]-j[1]);
                }
                countj++;
            }
            
            counti++;
        }

        std::sort(edges+1, edges+nedges+1, compare);
        
        
        for(int i = 1; i <= nedges; i++){
            
            if( find(edges[i].x) != find(edges[i].y) ){
                
                join(edges[i].x, edges[i].y);
                w += edges[i].dist;
            }
        }
        
        return w;
    }
};
```

This code is roughly better than 50% on time efficiency and better than 85% on memory efficiency.
