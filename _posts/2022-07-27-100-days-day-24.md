This series of post start on [this post](/blog/100-days-day-19).

This post we'll go over how to load the ROM in the memory. If you are experienced in file management in whichever language you're using right now, probably this post will be very useless. It will also not be very useful if you aren't using C/C++, as this will be a syntax-heavy lesson. 

So, let's start by creating a function. To load a ROM into our memory, we'll need the filename of the ROM and our CHIP8 struct.

```
int c8_load_game(struct CHIP8 *c8, char *filename){

    c8_init(c8);
    ...
}
```

The init at the beginning of the function is just good practice, you don't want to leave any reminiscing memory of the past game in the memory for a number of reasons. Also, this way we don't have to make a separate call to c8_init() at main.

Now we have to read the file. (Read it as a binary, as the rom isn't really a text file.)

```
FILE *game = fopen(filename, "rb");

if(!game){
    // never forget to check for errors :)
    fputs("FILE ERROR", stderr);
    return 1;
}
```

Great, this is all pretty standard. But now we have to use a technique I was not familiar with until starting this project.

To ensure we'll not overflow our memory, we have to check if the file we're trying to load isn't bigger than we can handle. This can be done by using two functions, fseek and ftell. fseek allows us to change our file pointer to a different place in the file. This is the declaration:

```int fseek(FILE *stream, long int offset, int whence)```

Stream is the file we're using, offset is how many bytes we will want to offset from the position we'll specify with whence, and whence recieves a constant that relates to a defined position in the file.

whence can recieve the constants:

- SEEK_SET: Beginning of the file
- SEEK_CUR: Current file pointer
- SEEK_END: End of file

So the trick involves using fseek with the offset 0 and whence = SEEK_END to put our pointer at the end of file. Then we can figure out how big is the offset between the SEEK_END and the beginning of the file using ftell.

```
fseek(game, 0, SEEK_END);
long size = ftell(game); // ftell returns a long int
rewind(game); // rewinds moves our file pointer back to
// the first position in the file.
```

Now we just have to create a dynamic memory buffer to read the game before passing it to our memory.

```
char *buffer = (char *)malloc(size);

if(!buffer){

    fputs("BUFFER ERROR", stderr);
    return 1;
}

if(fread(buffer, 1, size, game) != size){

    fputs("READ ERROR", stderr);
    return 1;
}
```

And now we can loop through the memory, adding each byte from the buffer to the memory. Remember to offset the 512 bytes on the memory, because the games in the CHIP-8 start at byte 512.

```
if(MAXSIZE > size){

    for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){
        
        c8->memory[i+512] = buffer[i];
    }
}else{

    fputs("ROM too big", stderr);
    return 1;
}
```

And to finish it off, don't forget to close the file and free the memory. 
```
    ...
    fclose(game);
    free(buffer);

    return 0;
}
```

Now the whole code:

```
int c8_load_game(struct CHIP8 *c8, char *filename){

    c8_init(c8);

    FILE *game = fopen(filename, "rb");

    if(!game){

        fputs("FILE ERROR", stderr);
        return 1;
    }

    fseek(game, 0, SEEK_END);
    long size = ftell(game);
    rewind(game);

    char *buffer = (char *)malloc(size);

    if(!buffer){

        fputs("BUFFER ERROR", stderr);
        return 1;
    }

    if(fread(buffer, 1, size, game) != size){

        fputs("READ ERROR", stderr);
        return 1;
    }

    if(MAXSIZE > size){

        for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){
        
            c8->memory[i+512] = buffer[i];
        }
    }else{

        fputs("ROM too big", stderr);
        return 1;
    }

    fclose(game);
    free(buffer);

    return 0;
}
```

We are at the final stretch now! We just have to add graphics now and we can finally play 50-year old games for a few minutes then go back to studying.
