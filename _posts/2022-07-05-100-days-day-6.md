I cannot spend more than 10 seconds without sneezing, so it was hard to learn new things today. So today I'm taking it easy, drinking a comforting cup of hibiscus tea wrapped in my blanket. But to keep my consistency, I decided to code in my comfort zone, which is the basics of DSA! 

I didn't use github back in my competitive programming days so I have learned many things which I didn't show to the world, so in an effort to fix that, I'm working now on a repository to save my implementations of various algorithms. Today feels like a graphs day, so I implemented a MST (minimum spanning tree) with Kruskal and the shortest path with Djikstra. (I hope I got that name right, I'm too lazy to google it.)

Today I'll walk you people through the Kruskal algorithm. It is an algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph, which is a tree that connects all vertices together with the minimum total edge weight possible. 

This algorithm functions this way in plain english:

```
sort edges in non-decreasing order
loop through the edges array
if the two vertices that the edge connects aren't connected, connect them both and add the edge to the minimum spanning tree
```

And that's it! The problem is actually implementing these steps, but it isn't much harder than writing it in english. We'll just use a technique called Union Find, which will do all the heavy lifting in the checking if they are connected and the connecting them both part. 

My implementation in C++ looks like this:

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

struct edge{
    int dist;
    int x, y;
};

const int maxn = 1e4+10;
int n, m;
int parent[maxn];
int weight[maxn];
edge edges[maxn];
edge mst[maxn];

bool compare(edge a, edge b){ 
    return a.dist < b.dist; 
}

int find(int x){
    if (parent[x] == x){
        return x;
    }
    return parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
}

void join(int a, int b){
    
    a = find(a);
    b = find(b);
    
    if (weight[a] < weight[b]) parent[a] = b;
    else if (weight[b] < weight[a]) parent[b] = a;
    else{

     parent[a] = b;
     weight[b]++;
    }
}


int main(){
    
    std::cin >> n >> m;
    
    for(int i = 1; i <= m; i++){

        std::cin >> edges[i].x >> edges[i].y >> edges[i].dist;
    }

    // initializing each compononent
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        parent[i] = i;
    }
    
    // sorting the edges
    std::sort(edges+1, edges+m+1, compare);
    
    int size = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= m; i++){
        
        if( find(edges[i].x) != find(edges[i].y) ){ // if the two vertices of a 
            // edge aren't in the same component, join them and 
            // add the edge to the MST

            join(edges[i].x, edges[i].y);
            mst[++size] = edges[i];
        }
    }
    
    int w = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= size; i++){

        w += mst[i].dist;
        std::cout << "edge " << i << ": " << mst[i].x << " " << mst[i].y << " " 
        << mst[i].dist << "\n";
    }

    std::cout << w << "\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

Let's talk about the non-trivial sections of the code. 

```
for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
    parent[i] = i;
}
```

This line serves to initializing the parent array. The way we'll check if two vertices are connected will be by checking if their parents is the same. Union Find will do this job, as the function find() will find the parent of a vertice, and the function join() will make two different vertices have the same parent if they don't already have.

In fact, let's talk about these functions right now.

```
int find(int x){
    if (parent[x] == x) return x;
    return parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
}
```

This function at the same time returns the parent of x and updates it. The first line serves as the base condition. If a vertice's parent is itself, we already found the parent. If not, we know that the parent of x is equal to the parent of the parent of x. 

Keep in mind that the parent will always be highest vertice up, not any vertice that is immediately connected to x. Maybe the right word would be the leader of the family instead of the parent. 

In this graph (made using [graphonline.ru](graphonline.ru)), for example:

![graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arthuramp/blog/master/graph.png)

At the end of the algorithm, 5's parent should be 1, not 3. 

But we already said enough of find, let's talk about join.

```
void join(int a, int b){
    
    a = find(a);
    b = find(b);
    
    if (weight[a] < weight[b]) parent[a] = b;
    else if (weight[b] < weight[a]) parent[b] = a;
    else{
        
     parent[a] = b;
     weight[b]++;
    }
}
```

As our way to know if a and b are in the same component requires us to check their parents, the first thing we do is to figure out who their parents are. We used the same variable name as they stop being useful after get their parents. 

Now the tricky part, the weight business. Let's consider this same graph.

![graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arthuramp/blog/master/graph.png)

The weight of 1 is three, which just means the deepest it goes is three levels after itself. (2->3->4 or 2->3->5). We always want to minimize the weight of the leader of the component, because as the weight increases, the number of iterations to find the parent of the lowest vertices increase as well.

Looking at the image, we can reach a conclusion. If we append to 1 any graph that has a weight lower than 3, it will not increase the weight of 1, as it won't lead to any sequence of nodes that goes deeper than 3 levels. In counterpart, if we try to join a graph with a weight higher than 3, we should just append 1 to the other graph instead of the opposite. 

The only situation where any weight increases is when the two graphs have the same size. In that case, there is nothing to do to stop the weight from increasing. 

These things I described is exactly what we do on the rest of the join function.

Now that we discussed Union Find in decent depth, the rest of the code will be a piece of cake. Let's go to the main code logic. 

```
int size = 0;
for(int i = 1; i <= m; i++){
        
    if( find(edges[i].x) != find(edges[i].y) ){ // if the two vertices of a 
        // edge aren't in the same component, join them and 
        // add the edge to the MST

        join(edges[i].x, edges[i].y);
        mst[++size] = edges[i];
    }
}
```

In this case, the comments speaks for themselves. We loop through the edges, and if find() for both vertices of the edge lead don't lead to the same parent, we just join them, thus making them have the same parent, and add the edge on the MST. 

And that's it! You just learned how to make an array with all the edges of the minimum spanning tree of a given graph!

If I'm better tomorrow, we will go back to network programming! Thank you for reading, and if you have any questions, hit me up at arthurmpapp@gmail.com
