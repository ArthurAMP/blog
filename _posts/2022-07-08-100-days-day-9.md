title: day 9 - network pt5 - netcat-like listener!

Finally! I finished making a listener in C to go with my reverse shell! Yes, I know netcat is a thing, but making my own sounds fun, and maybe I can add some code lines to upgrade the dumb shell to a tty shell, so I can convince myself I'm doing something useful in my life. 

If you just wanna see the code, [click here](https://github.com/ArthurAMP/listener-c)!

Note, this lesson will assume you read [day 7](/blog/100-days-day-7).

The code looks something like this: 

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netdb.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define PORT "8888"
#define BACKLOG 10

int main(void){
    
    int sockfd, new_sockfd;
    struct addrinfo hints, *res, *p;
    struct sockaddr_storage their_addr;
    int yes = 1;
    socklen_t sin_size;

    memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(hints));
    hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC;
    hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
    hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE; 

    int status;
    if((status = getaddrinfo(NULL, PORT, &hints, &res)) != 0){
        
        fprintf(stderr, "getaddrinfo: %s\n", gai_strerror(status));
        return 1;
    }


    for(p = res; p != NULL; p = p->ai_next){
    
        if((sockfd = socket(p->ai_family, 
                        p->ai_socktype, 
                        p->ai_protocol)) == -1){
            
            perror("socket");
            continue; 
        }
        
        if(setsockopt(sockfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &yes, sizeof(yes))){
            
            perror("setsockopt");
            exit(1);
        }

        if(bind(sockfd, p->ai_addr, p->ai_addrlen) == -1){
            
            close(sockfd);
            perror("connect");
            continue;
        }

        break;
    }

    freeaddrinfo(res);

    if(p == NULL){
        
        fprintf(stderr, "failed to bind socket");
        return 2;
    }
    
    if(listen(sockfd, BACKLOG) == -1){

        perror("listen");
        exit(1);
    }

    printf("server: waiting for connections...\n");
    
    sin_size = sizeof(their_addr);
    new_sockfd = accept(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&their_addr, &sin_size);

    if(new_sockfd == -1){
        
        perror("accept");
        return 3;
    } 
    
    if(!fork()){

        close(sockfd);

        char buffer[1024];
        int buffsize;
        
        while(1){ 
            
            if((buffsize = read(0, buffer, 1024)) <= 0){
                
                perror("send");
                break;
            }
            if(write(new_sockfd, buffer, buffsize)<=0){
                
                perror("write");
                break;
            }
        }
        
        close(new_sockfd);
        
        exit(0);
    }

    close(sockfd);

    char buffer[1024];
    int buffsize;
    while(1){ 
        
        if((buffsize = read(new_sockfd, buffer, 1024)) <= 0){
            
            perror("recv");
            break;
        }
        write(1, buffer, buffsize);
    }


    close(new_sockfd);
    
    return 0;
}
```

Let's talk about the new things in the code when compared to the client.

```
if(setsockopt(sockfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &yes, sizeof(yes))){
            
    perror("setsockopt");
    exit(1);
}
```

Sometimes when executing a socket program, it will say that the address is already in use even when you're not actively using it anymore, so you wouldn't normally be able to use the port. Using this piece of code will allow your code to reuse the port.

```
if(bind(sockfd, p->ai_addr, p->ai_addrlen) == -1){
            
    close(sockfd);
    perror("connect");
    continue;
}
```

Instead of connect(), in the server we use the syscall bind(). This allows us to bind our socket to an specific port. 

```
if(listen(sockfd, BACKLOG) == -1){

    perror("listen");
    exit(1);
}
```

This system call will make the kernel recieve the connections and leave them waiting until we accept() them. Take note that listen() won't stop the code execution, the listening will be happening in the kernel and not in the process of our code.

This is the first time I showed in code this BACKLOG define. It is related to the maximum amount of connections we will leave waiting in the queue. You might be wondering, "but Arthur, why you let the BACKLOG define be 10 if your code will only handle at most one connection?" That's a good question. I just noticed this while typing this very same paragraph. I'm too lazy to correct that, oh well.

What will actually stop the code to wait for a connection is the accept(). Let's take a look at it. 

```
new_sockfd = accept(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&their_addr, &sin_size);
```

This will make the struct their_addr recieve the data from the person that connected to our socket, and the system call will estabilish a connection where we can send and recieve TCP packets. Now all that we have to handle is the input and output. 

```
if(!fork()){

    close(sockfd);

    char buffer[1024];
    int buffsize;
        
    while(1){ 
            
        if((buffsize = read(0, buffer, 1024)) <= 0){
                
            perror("send");
            break;
        }
        if(write(new_sockfd, buffer, buffsize)<=0){
                
            perror("write");
            break;
        }
    }
    
    close(new_sockfd);
    exit();
}
```

```if(!fork())```is very very interesting. It creates a child process starting from the line we made the system call. The main and the child processes will have a different return on the fork() function, the child will return 0 and the parent will return the PID of the child process. As !fork() is only true on the child process, the code inside the if will only run on the child.

This is perfect for us, because we want to have two while(1)s running at the same time. One to handle the input of the socket and one handling the output of the socket. 

The code inside the if has a simple logic. It reads to the buffer string 1024 bytes from the stdin file descriptor, which will be the input of the terminal, and it will write to the new_sockfd, which is equivalent to send()ing the buffer string to the client.

```
char buffer[1024];
int buffsize;
while(1){ 
        
    if((buffsize = read(new_sockfd, buffer, 1024)) <= 0){
            
        perror("recv");
        break;
    }
    write(1, buffer, buffsize);
}
```

This is basically the opposite of the code we just discussed. We read from the new_sockfd, which is equivalent of recieving data from the client using recv(), and then we write it to the stdout, which will be the output of our terminal.

And this is basically all! You successfully learned how to make a dollar store version of Netcat! This project taught me a lot about network programming, and I hope it can teach you a thing or two as well!

I have no plans for tomorrow, but probably won't be related to network programming at all. Maybe I'll check out WebAssembly :p

See ya!
